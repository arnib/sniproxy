SNI Proxy
=========

Proxies incoming HTTP and TLS connections based on the hostname contained in
the initial request. This enables HTTPS name based virtual hosting to separate
backend servers without the installing the private key on the proxy machine.

Features
--------
+ Name-based proxying of HTTPS without decrypting traffic. No keys or
  certificates required.
+ Supports both TLS and HTTP protocols.
+ Supports IPv4, IPv6 and Unix domain sockets for both back end servers and
  listeners.
+ Supports multiple listening sockets per instance.

Usage
-----

    Usage: sniproxy [-c <config>] [-f]
        -c  configuration file, defaults to /etc/sniproxy.conf
        -f  run in foreground, do not drop privileges


Installation
------------

For Debian or Fedora based Linux distributions see building packages below.

**Prerequisites**

+ Autotools (autoconf, automake and libtool)
+ libev4 and libpcre development headers
+ Perl and cURL for test suite

**Install**

    ./autogen.sh && ./configure && make check && sudo make install

Building Debian/Ubuntu package
==============================

This is the preferred installation method on recent Debian based distributions:

1. Install required packages

    sudo apt-get install dpkg-dev cdbs debhelper dh-autoreconf libev-dev libpcre3-dev

2. Build a Debian package

    dpkg-buildpackage

3. Install the resulting package

    sudo dpkg -i ../sniproxy_<version>_<arch>.deb

**Note on Upgrading**

The version of sniproxy is not automatically updated after each commit, so if
you are upgrading to later version 10 version number of the sniproxy package
may not have actually changed. This may cause issues with the upgrade process.
It is recommended you uninstall `sudo apt-get remove sniproxy` then reinstall
the new version.

Building Fedora/RedHat package
==============================

This is the preferred installation method for modern Fedora based distributions.

1. Install required packages

    sudo yum install rpmbuild autoconf automake curl libev-devel pcre-devel perl

2. First build a distribution tarball:

    ./autogen && ./configure && make dist

3. Build a RPM package
    
    rpmbuild --define "_sourcedir `pwd`" -ba sniproxy.spec

4. Install resulting RPM

    sudo yum install ../sniproxy-<version>.<arch>.rpm

I've used Scientific Linux 6 a fair amount, but I prefer Debian based
distributions. I do not test building RPMs frequently (SL6 doesn't have a
libev-devel package). This build process may not follow the current Fedora
packaging standards, and may not even work.


Configuration Syntax
--------------------

    user daemon

    listener 127.0.0.1 443 {
        protocol tls
        table "TableName"
    }

    table "TableName" {
        # Match exact request hostnames
        example.com 192.0.2.10      4343
        example.net 2001:DB8::1:10  443
        # Or use PCRE to match
        .*\\.com    2001:DB8::1:11  443
        # Combining PCRE and wildcard will resolve the hostname client requested and proxy to it
        .*\\.edu    *               443
    }
